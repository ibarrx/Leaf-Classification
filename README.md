# Leaf-Classification
CSE 120 Capstone Project

To run the project on your own device:

You must have the [expo go](https://expo.dev/client) app installed on your testing device and also [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) installed on your development device. 
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) is also required for MacOS/Linux.

You need to run 

    npm install
    npx expo start

This will start a local environment session on your network. You can then scan the QR code generated in the terminal and it will appear on your phone.

<span style="color: red;">Please Note:</span>  On IOS (and possibly Android), Expo Go will ask your permission to find devices on your network. This part is necessary to run on your device.
If you accidentally decline, you need to go to:

    Settings -> Expo Go -> Local Network -> (Enabled)

To stop the project, you can use CTRL + C
